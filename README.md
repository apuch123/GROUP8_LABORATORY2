# GROUP8_LABORATORY2
Configure one general-purpose timer in up-counting mode with appropriate prescaler and auto-reload values to generate a 500 ms update interrupt, and in its ISR toggle an LED to achieve precise blinking without using HAL_Delay().
Configure a second timer (or another channel) for PWM output on a chosen pin, attach an LED with a resistor, and implement code that smoothly varies the duty cycle to fade the LED in and out.
Deliver your full STM32CubeIDE project folder, a short video demonstrating both the timer-driven blink and PWM fade, and a brief report detailing your timer configuration calculations
